Question : 
Provide me the sample data of any table named "institution_reports"

Answer : 
To answer this question you you need to find the id of the table from the table_entity table

example query: 
    select id from table_entity where JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(json, "$.name")) = "institution_reports"

further to get the sample data you need to query the table entity_extension where id is table id fetched from the above query and jsonSchema is tableData
the json column of this table contains the sample data.

example query:
    select JSON_UNQUOTE((JSON_EXTRACT(json, "$.rows"))) from entity_extension where id = (select id from table_entity where JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(json, "$.name")) = "institution_reports") and jsonSchema = "tableData"
