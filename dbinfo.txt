Hereâ€™s an overview of the relationships between the tables classification, tag, tag_usage, glossary_entity, and glossary_term_entity and their connections with other tables in the openmetadata database:

1. Classification
Description: The classification table stores metadata about different classifications used within the system. These classifications are used to group tags and glossary terms under meaningful categories like "Confidential", "PII", "Sensitive", etc.
Relationships:
tag: Tags can belong to a classification, meaning each tag can be associated with one or more classifications. This creates a hierarchical structure where classifications are used to organize tags.
glossary_term_entity: Glossary terms may also be categorized under classifications. This helps in structuring the glossary terms into logical categories.
Other Tables: Classifications might indirectly influence entities like table_entity, database_entity, etc., where tags and glossary terms are applied.
2. Tag
Description: The tag table stores metadata about tags. Tags are keywords or labels that can be applied to various metadata entities (e.g., tables, columns, dashboards) to provide additional context or classification.
Relationships:
classification: Tags are often grouped under classifications. A tag can belong to one or more classifications, defining its role or sensitivity level within the metadata system.
tag_usage: The tag_usage table tracks where and how tags are used across the system, linking tags to specific metadata entities (e.g., tables, columns).
Other Tables: Tags are applied to entities such as table_entity, database_entity, dashboard_entity, pipeline_entity, etc., to categorize or describe these entities.
3. Tag Usage
Description: The tag_usage table tracks the usage of tags across different metadata entities. It records which tags are applied to which entities, the type of label used (e.g., primary or secondary), and the state of the tag usage.
Relationships:
tag: tag_usage directly references tags, indicating how they are applied across the system.
Other Tables: tag_usage creates links to various metadata entities (e.g., table_entity, dashboard_entity, pipeline_entity, column_entity) by associating these entities with specific tags.
4. Glossary Entity
Description: The glossary_entity table stores metadata about glossaries. A glossary is a collection of terms that have specific meanings within the context of the metadata system. Glossaries are used to ensure consistent use of terminology across the organization.
Relationships:
glossary_term_entity: The glossary_entity table is the parent of the glossary_term_entity table. Each glossary can contain multiple glossary terms that define specific concepts or terms used in the metadata system.
Other Tables: Glossaries might be referenced indirectly through glossary terms when these terms are applied to entities such as table_entity, column_entity, or dashboard_entity.
5. Glossary Term Entity
Description: The glossary_term_entity table stores metadata about individual glossary terms. A glossary term defines a specific concept or item that is part of a larger glossary.
Relationships:
glossary_entity: Glossary terms belong to a glossary, linking them back to their parent glossary.
classification: Glossary terms can be classified under different classifications, similar to tags. This allows for the organization of glossary terms under categories such as "Confidential", "PII", etc.
Other Tables: Glossary terms can be applied to various metadata entities (e.g., table_entity, column_entity, dashboard_entity) to define or describe the data within these entities. They help in maintaining consistent terminology across the metadata system.
Relationships with Other Tables in the Database:
Metadata Entities: The tags and glossary terms are primarily used in the context of metadata entities like table_entity, database_entity, dashboard_entity, pipeline_entity, etc. They are applied to these entities to provide additional context, classification, or description.
Search and Discovery: Tags and glossary terms play a crucial role in search and discovery within the metadata system. They enable users to find and filter entities based on specific keywords or terms.
Security and Compliance: Classifications (linked with tags and glossary terms) help enforce security and compliance policies. For example, data classified as "Confidential" may be subject to different access controls.
Example Scenarios:
Tagging a Table: A table_entity might be tagged with a tag classified under "Sensitive". This relationship would be reflected in the tag_usage table, linking the table's fully qualified name with the tag.
Applying a Glossary Term: A column in a table could be associated with a glossary term (e.g., "Customer ID"), ensuring that all instances of that column across different tables have a consistent definition.
Classifying Data: A tag such as "PII" (Personally Identifiable Information) could be classified under "Confidential". When applied to an entity, this classification could trigger specific compliance checks or access restrictions.
These relationships help in maintaining a well-organized, secure, and compliant metadata environment, making it easier to manage and discover data across the organization.




Relationships Between test_case, test_definition, test_suite, and test_connection_definition
Overview:
These tables are part of the testing framework within the OpenMetadata system. They store information related to test cases, their definitions, test suites, and connections required to run the tests. Here's how they relate to each other and other tables in the database:

1. test_case
Description: Stores information about individual test cases, including their metadata, the entity they are associated with, and the test definition they are based on.
Relationships:
test_definition: Each test_case is associated with a test_definition, which defines what the test is supposed to validate. This relationship is crucial for understanding the purpose of a test case.
test_suite: A test_case can belong to a test_suite, grouping it with other related test cases that should be run together.
Other Tables: The entityFQN in test_case links to various metadata entities (e.g., table_entity, dashboard_entity) to specify what the test case is validating.
2. test_definition
Description: Contains the definitions for tests, detailing what they validate and the type of data they operate on.
Relationships:
test_case: A test_definition can be linked to multiple test_case entries, as it defines the test logic that is applied to different entities.
test_suite: A test_suite might reference multiple test_definition entries to define the scope of the suite.
Other Tables: entityType in test_definition can reference different entity types in the database (e.g., table_entity, column_entity), indicating what kind of metadata entities the test applies to.
3. test_suite
Description: Represents a collection of test cases that should be run together. It groups related tests to ensure comprehensive validation of specific aspects of the system.
Relationships:
test_case: A test_suite consists of multiple test_case entries, forming a group of tests that are related or need to be executed together.
test_definition: A test_suite can be associated with multiple test_definition entries, determining the types of tests included in the suite.
Other Tables: Indirectly related to entities that test_case and test_definition are associated with.
4. test_connection_definition
Description: Stores connection details required to execute tests. These connections might be specific to certain test cases or suites that need to connect to specific databases or services to retrieve data for validation.
Relationships:
test_case: A test_case might reference a test_connection_definition if it needs specific connection details to be executed.
Other Tables: The fullyQualifiedName in test_connection_definition might reference specific services or data sources that the connection is targeting.
